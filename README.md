# Virtual Memory Simulater
## CSE422S project 3

This project contains three separate executables: a page replacement
simulator vmsim, and two page reference generators: vmgenU and vmgenWS.

* vmsim.cpp is the virtual memory simulater
* vmgenU.cpp is a random page reference generator
* vmgenWS.cpp generates page references that simulate the working set behavior
